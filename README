The NURBS-based HUman Brain (NHUB) Phatom:

Based on a segmented MRI dataset of a normal subject (100 structures) including the ability to simulate motion of the brain (3 translation, 3 rotation).

Please reference the following work (in which the construction of the phantom has been more elaborately mentioned):

A. Rahmim, K. Dinelle, J. C. Cheng, M. A. Shilov, W. P. Segars, S. C. Lidstone, S. Blinder, O. G. Rousset, H. Vajihollahi, B. M. W. Tsui, D. F. Wong, and V. Sossi, "Accurate event-driven motion compensation in high-resolution PET incorporating scattered and random events", IEEE Trans. Med. Imag., vol. 27, pp. 1018-1033, 2008.


STEPS for use:

1) Re-compile
make clean
make

2) USAGE: ./dncat_bin [options] gen_par out_base

  gen_par: general parameter filename
  out_basename: base string for output files

Rigid motion can also be incorporated in the phantom for the six degress of freedom.

       [-x] x translation in mm's
       [-y] y translation in mm's
       [-z] z translation in mm's
       [-X] x rotation in degrees
       [-Y] y rotation in degrees
       [-Z] z rotation in degrees


3) Example USAGE:
./dncat_bin test.par resulting_image1
will create a 128x128x128 sample brain image (see test.par for definitions)
The values we have used in this particular example are somewhat close to a typical anatomic MR study (but this may need to be better tuned and double-checked for the various regions).
